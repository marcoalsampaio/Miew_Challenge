### Inspiration

[https://www.willin.es/](https://www.willin.es/)

I found this website and liked the design, so I used it as inspiration.
I liked the animations and the way that the content is presented. Tried to copy some features from it.
I think that the colours create a good contrast between the content and the background. Thought that would be simpler to copy.
